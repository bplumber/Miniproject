Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by the coronavirus 2, which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2). In December of this year, the first known case was discovered in Wuhan, China. [7] Since then, the disease has spread around the world, resulting in the current COVID-19 pandemic. [8]
Fever,[9] cough, headache,[10] weariness, breathing difficulty, loss of smell, and loss of taste are common symptoms of COVID19. [11][12][13] Symptoms might appear anywhere from one to fourteen days after being exposed to the virus. At least one-third of those who are afflicted do not show any signs or symptoms. [14] The majority (81%) of those who acquire symptoms noticeable enough to be classified as patients have mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), whereas 14% have severe symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging), and 5% have critical symptoms (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction).Severe symptoms are more likely to emerge in the elderly. Some persons continue to have a variety of symptoms (long COVID) months after recovery, and organ damage has been reported. [16] Long-term research are being conducted to learn more about the disease's long-term impact. [16]
COVID19 is spread through the air when droplets and minute airborne particles harbouring the virus are inhaled. Breathing them in is most dangerous when individuals are close together, but they can also be inhaled over greater distances, especially indoors. Transmission can also occur if contaminated fluids are splashed or sprayed in the eyes, nose, or mouth, as well as via contaminated surfaces. People can be contagious for up to 20 days after contracting the virus, and they can spread it even if they don't show any symptoms. [17] [18]
